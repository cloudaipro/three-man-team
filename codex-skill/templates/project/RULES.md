# Project Rules
*The project's quality contract. Drafted by the Architect from this project's own docs and
tooling — never invented. Role-neutral by design: renaming the team never touches this file.*

Machines check what machines can check. Human review is for judgment — spec fit, drift,
design. Everything below the judgment line lives here, as commands and standing rules,
so the Reviewer's attention is spent only on what no command can verify.

---

## Mechanical Gate
*Commands that must pass before any review request. The Builder runs them last thing before
signaling done and records the results in handoff/REVIEW-REQUEST.md. A failing gate never
reaches the Reviewer — it is the Builder's to fix.*

Drafted at setup from this project's own tooling — test runner, linter, type checker, build.
If the project has no runnable checks yet, keep the handoff-size row below and write
`NO GATE DEFINED` beside it for the project's own checks; a project that cannot verify itself
mechanically pays for it in review cycles.

| Command | Proves |
|---|---|
| `awk 'END{exit (NR>400)}' handoff/BUILD-LOG.md` | BUILD-LOG has not outgrown rotation. Ships with the framework — do not delete it |
| `[command]` | [What passing means — e.g. "no lint errors", "all tests green", "build compiles"] |

The handoff-size row is the one gate command the framework provides. It is here because the
Builder writes BUILD-LOG and the Architect rotates it — so without a mechanical check, the
person creating the growth never sees the threshold, and the person who can act on it only
notices by accident. Failing this row is not a code defect: signal it to the Architect, who
rotates. Do not "fix" it by trimming your own entry after the fact.

It is written with `awk`, not `test "$(wc -l < …)"`, on purpose: with the file missing, the
`wc` form exits 0 under zsh (empty string compares as an integer) and reports a green gate
for a BUILD-LOG that is not there. The `awk` form exits non-zero for missing, oversized, and
unreadable alike — L-1's rule, applied to the framework's own gate command.

## Standing Rules
*Project-specific rules the Reviewer checks on every step. Each rule carries its source —
a rule that cannot say where it came from gets deleted, not enforced.*

New rules start **advisory** — the Reviewer flags violations but they do not block.
The Project Owner promotes a rule to **blocking** only after it has caught real problems
without false alarms. Observe first, enforce second.

| # | Rule | Source | Fixable by | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | [Stated so a violation is objectively checkable] | [Doc, decision, or Lesson L-N it comes from] | builder / architect / owner | advisory |

Rules are born two ways: drafted at setup from the project's written docs, or promoted from
BUILD-LOG `## Lessons` when the same lesson lands twice. A rule that keeps flagging things
nobody fixes is noise — revisit its wording or retire it.

## Iron Rules
*Process invariants. These ship with the framework and are not project-specific.
Violating one is a process bug — log a Lesson, then fix the process, not just the instance.*

1. The Builder never edits REVIEW-FEEDBACK.md. The Reviewer never edits code.
2. A failing or missing Mechanical Gate never reaches the Reviewer.
3. Nothing deploys without the Architect's sign-off and the Project Owner's explicit go-ahead.
4. Scope lock: out-of-scope work goes to BUILD-LOG Known Gaps — never into the current step.
5. Handoff files are the record. A decision that lives only in chat does not exist.
